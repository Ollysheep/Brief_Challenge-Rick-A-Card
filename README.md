#Brief_Challenge-Rick-A-Card

## Resource

[Rick & Morty - API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character)

## Context of the project

As an application dev designer, you will have to set up interfaces, test these interfaces using an end-to-end testing framework (Cypress) and deploy your application on a Github Page, all automatically in a Devops approach.

The objective is to produce a POC of a small application using a public API to retrieve data from the Rick & Morty universe.

**Expression of need:** A countdown allows you to activate a button to randomly draw a character card (you can only draw a card every 2 hours), once the card is drawn it is displayed and allows you to visualize character information (image, name, status, species, character number) in a clear and stylized manner.

_Bonus: Once a card is drawn it must be stored in a virtual wallet (localstorage for example) to keep track of the different cards already drawn._
